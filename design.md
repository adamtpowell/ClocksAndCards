	* Others could want to be placed at the beginning.

* Prevent other spaces from being used.
* Could conjure cards into your deck.

## Instants - Cards / Gears
* Magnifiying Glass - Instant - Draw two cards at the cost of gears.
	* Probably very strong, but thats ok, this is a single player deck builder.
* Fire - Instant - Adds gears one time
	* Adding these to your deck is a resource tradeoff
* Clock - Instant - Double gear production for all buildings in a tile
	* Encourages inconsistent but strong production
* Arrow - Instant - Click a building to move it to another space. Draw a card - costs gears, but allows interesting plays.
	* Can synergize with things that like activation
