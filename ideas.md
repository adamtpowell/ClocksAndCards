# Ludum Dare 51

Theme: Every 10 Seconds (OH NO VERY SAD)

## Short short list

* Analog computing / signal processing game
    * Need to make it 10hz
    * Multiplier nodes
    * FM Nodes - cancel things out using this?
    * Need to look more into this.


* 10 second levels, 10 seconds to change loadout / upgrade
    * Could be the same level

* Rube goldberg machine
    * Elevators
    * Cranes
    * Ramps
    * Loops
    * Drawing might be too easy.

* Real time TCG based off of intervals
    * RTS x TCG
    * Clock / time / interval themed enemies.
    * Permanents (like artifacts) would trigger at the start of every interval.
        * Draw extra cards if conditions are met.
        * Spawn extra units
        * Upgrade cards in hand - build up
    * Units would go in lanes? Cards could switch them between lanes? Netrunner??
    * Spells could switch units between lanes or duplicate them
        * Stun units
    * Interactions with lanes could be creature abilities. Moving things to other lanes to get through?
        * Duplicate units within lanes
    * Deck builder so no need to be balanced.

* Congress dating simulator

## Possible Game Ideas

* **Sonar, you can only see things every 10 seconds**
* Those interval things, manipulate analog computing modules to trigger at 10hz.
    * **Or manipulate a 10hz signal into different things by transforming it.**
* **Roguelite where everything is added very very quickly - i.e. you get a choice of upgrades after every 10 seconds.**
    * You get a level and have 10 seconds to view and complete it.
    * You have 10 seconds to pick an upgrade
    * Enemies and powers are time based in some way, could speed up and slow down time.
    * The background would in some way feature a clock or countdown
    * If you failed, game over.

* **Need to make rube goldberg machines that trigger every 10 seconds using different arrangements of parts**
* **A game about clocks or a factory floor - controlling a clock mechanism as part of a factory. Could be a more interesting mechanical rythm game.**
* **Real time tcg - draw a card every 10 seconds, other actions take place in real time, almost like an rts**
    * Adds an element of thinking fast and real timing.
    * A different element of the control / aggro sort of thing.
    * Permanents could trigger on that clock
    * Time themed, maybe pulling things from history? Or gear people?

## Other Game Ideas

* Rythm game where you have to do things at 6bpm - not fun but could be funny?
    * Exaggerate the regular juicy elements of rythm games as if its a really good beat.
    * Officially the worlds slowest rythm game.
    * Wouldn't have to literally be that slow, there could be multiple notes between a beat.

* The world changes every 10 seconds - a platformer gets changed platforms?
* Etch a sketch style stuff, which gets erased every 10 seconds.
    * Platformer?
    * Each level gets drawn and you can play it?
* Reading the stars

* something about a globe and seconds as a unit of time?
* What if the player is in control of time itself?
    * Things are happening every 10 seconds but not in the game itself.
    * Small things have time seemingly move slower?
* Every 10 seconds, something happens somewhere on the globe
    * Eradicate hunger on a global scale by using logisitics?
    * Or otherwise try to intervene in small trageties, try to strike a hopeful tone.

* A game about cron - programming
    * Distributed systems or learning arcane procedural command line syntax.

* Standard water level rising or something being added to the danger every 10 seconds.
* Short order cook - putting together burgers, mouse based for maximum chaos.

* Need to convince people to accept your bill by bargaining in congress.
    * Bills need to be seconded

* There can be multiple things happening at once
    * Multiple 10 second intervals at once. Add more.

* Time in an elevator

* Intervals of doors opening for access.

* Time travel
    * Effect the past
    * Avoid creating paradoxes (or don't)
    * Make things easier for yourself.



* Rythm game with different polyrythms at 6 bpm

## Other definitions of seconds

* Seconds are also a measurement of angle
    * Very small, only useful for like GPS measurements.

* Food, taking seconds?
    * Not a human a squirrel

* Congress
